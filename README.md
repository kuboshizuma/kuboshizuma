# About Me

- [ACES,Inc](https://acesinc.co.jp) Co-Founder
  - Currently, we are developing [SHARON](https://sharon.jp/), which is an API/SDK service for image recognition algorithms, and working on collaboration projects with companies in various fields.
  - Now hiring algorithm engineers and software engineers! ([recruit page](https://acesinc.co.jp/recruit.html))
- Aspects of an algorithm developer
  - My research area is image generation by a deep generative model. Especially engaged in computer vision in fasion field.

  - Currently engaged in general development of computer vision algorithms and service development. In paticular I am focus on face analysis, object recognition, and pose estimation algorithms.
- Aspects of a software developer
  - I have been developing multiple web services since I was a university student. The most exprerienced web framework is Ruby on Rails and I like Ruby.
  - Recently, Python is often used to match an algorithm development language.
  - Java/Kotlin and swift has started to be used for native application development.
